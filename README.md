# Hello there! Apa Kabar-mu?

### My name's Joko Sukino, but my friends call me "dimac"

My profile pic is [Lupusregina Beta](https://mywaifulist.moe/waifu/lupusregina-beta-overlord).

I'm a student, and hasn't yet graduated. I don't code for work or commission, i only code for fun because i really have nothing else to do.

The only coding skills i got is on JavaScript, specifically NodeJS. I didn't learn how to code for real, and only skimmed through few tutorials and stackoverflow pages while slowly picking up knowledge on JS.

I'm not a native english speaker, so pardon my bad English. [I originate from here!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia)

Here's a cute pic that i found, feel free to screenshot and enjoy;
